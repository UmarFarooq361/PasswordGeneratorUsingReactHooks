# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator built with React. I used useState, useCallback, useEffect, useRef to understand and optimise react app using best practices. It allows users to generate passwords with customizable lengths and optional inclusion of numbers and special characters.

## Features

- Generate a random password with a customizable length
